# Billing

* Go to *Billing Preferences* and check call preferences, like *Invoice delivery preferences* or *AWS Free Tier alerts*.
* Setup a budget by going to *Budgets* -> *Use a template* -> *Create budget*.

# Creating new accounts

* Gmail + trick. E.g. originalemailname+alias@gmail.com
* Add MFA
* Add Budget
* Enabled IAM User & Role Access to billing (*Account* -> *IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information*)

# IAM Basics

* Account and Account Root User can be thought as the same thing. Account Root User cannot be restricted in any way.
* Every AWS Account comes with its own IAM database. IAM is globally resilient service. So any data is always secure across all AWS regions. AWS Account trusts fully IAM. IAM can do anything in the account. There are restrictions around billing and account closure. Operationally, IAM can do as much as root user.

IAM let's you create three different type of identity objects:
* User - identities which represent humans or applications that need access to your account.
* Group - collection of related users e.g. development team, finance or HR.
* Role - can be used by AWS Services, or for granting external access to your account.
 
Generally, you pick IAM Users when you can identify an individual user or application. Roles tend to get used when the number of things is uncertain. If you want to grant users of external accounts access to say a simple storage service bucket or if you want to allow AWS services themselves to interact on your behalf, you use roles.

IAM Policy - they define, allow or deny access to AWS Services. You can attach them to user, group and roles.

IAM has 3 main jobs:
* It is an Identity Provider or IDP. It let's you create, delete modify identities.
* It also authenticates identities known as security principle.
* Authorizes - allows or denies access to resource.

IAM summary:
* No Cost
* Global service / Global resilience
* Allow or Deny its identities on its AWS account
* No direct control on external accounts or users
* Identity federation and MFA

# Setting up Admin User

You can set AWS Account Alias: IAM -> IAM Dashboard -> AWS Account -> Account Alias (it has to be globally unique).

Users -> Create User -> Set Permissions (attach policies directly AdministratorAccess).

To test login now, copy "Sign-in URL for IAM users in this account" (which was generated using Account Alias)

# IAM Access Keys

IAM Acess Keys are long term credentials used by IAM Users. When you're using UI you will generally user and password, while when you use CLI - Access Keys.

Access Keys are similar to user and password, but there are crucial differences:
* An IAM User has 1 username and 1 password. It cannot have more. Username is public part and password is private part.
* An IAM User can have two access keys (it can have zero, one or two maximum). Access keys can be created, deleted made inactive or active. Just like username and password, access keys are formed from two parts: Access Key ID; Secret Access Key. When you create Access Keys, AWS provides both.

By rotating access key it means to delete the current one and replace with new one. You cannot modify access key secret, only to delete and recreate. That is why you can have up to two access keys.

**Only IAM Users have access keys.** IAM Roles don't use access keys.

Click on top right IAM user -> Security Credentials -> Access keys.

## Configure AWS CLI tool

```
aws configure
```

Will configure default profile. To configure named profile (multiple profiles are supported):

```
aws configure --profile iamadmin-general
```

To use named profile listing S3 buckets:

```
aws s3 ls --profile iamadmin-general
```

# Stateless firewall vs Stateful firewall

Stateless firewal (in AWS it is Network ACL/NACL) does not understand Layer 4 connections. That is why you need to define both outbound and inbound traffic. For example, an application's destination is `<ip_address>:443`, while the source is `<ip_address>:<ephemeral_port>`. When application connects to a machine defined in ip_address, it expects a response, hence ingress traffic has to be whitelistes as well. In stateful firewall case, or security groups in AWS, is when ingress traffic is automatically allowed.
