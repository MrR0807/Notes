# Billing

* Go to *Billing Preferences* and check call preferences, like *Invoice delivery preferences* or *AWS Free Tier alerts*.
* Setup a budget by going to *Budgets* -> *Use a template* -> *Create budget*.

# Creating new accounts

* Gmail + trick. E.g. originalemailname+alias@gmail.com
* Add MFA
* Add Budget
* Enabled IAM User & Role Access to billing (*Account* -> *IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information*)

# IAM Basics

* Account and Account Root User can be thought as the same thing. Account Root User cannot be restricted in any way.
* Every AWS Account comes with its own IAM database. IAM is globally resilient service. So any data is always secure across all AWS regions. AWS Account trusts fully IAM. IAM can do anything in the account. There are restrictions around billing and account closure. Operationally, IAM can do as much as root user.

  IAM let's you create three different type of identity objects:
  * User - identities which represent humans or applications that need access to your account.
  * Group - collection of related users e.g. development team, finance or HR.
  * Role - can be used by AWS Services, or for granting external access to your account.
 
Generally, you pick IAM Users when you can identify an individual user or application. Roles tend to get used when the number of things is uncertain. If you want to grant users of external accounts access to say a simple storage service bucket or if you want to allow AWS services themselves to interact on your behalf, you use roles.

IAM Policy - they define, allow or deny access to AWS Services. You can attach them to user, group and roles.

IAM has 3 main jobs:
* It is an Identity Provider or IDP. It let's you create, delete modify identities.
* It also authenticates identities known as security principle.
* Authorizes - allows or denies access to resource.

IAM summary:
* No Cost
* Global service / Global resilience
* Allow or Deny its identities on its AWS account
* No direct control on external accounts or users
* Identity federation and MFA
